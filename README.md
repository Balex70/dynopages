## How to use?

   - Be aware, that during migration all localized versions of page will be created, even if localized version of page doesn't exist in theme!
   - If during migration some field of localized page is not translated, data from default language will be used!
* Migrate existing Static pages to database. You can migrate all static pages only. If at least one static page exists in database already, migration will not be possible!
